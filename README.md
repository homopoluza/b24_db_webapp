# b24_db_webapp

This prototype web app was created based on a client's request. The app was built with PHP, MySQL, Bitrix24 API, and classless CSS water. 
It ensures data security by checking the password hash and the user session against the database.

The app allows the user to receive, store, and process information about successful deals from Bitrix24, and to download the data as an Excel file.
